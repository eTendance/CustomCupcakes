-ID-name associations for cupcake flavors, fillings, toppings, etc need to be pulled from the json file menu.json (from raley's docs)
-Make the order form post to ajax.php using ajax as oppose to the current default method
-When the form is posted, the cart and favorites need to be refreshed


Here are some of the ajax requests that can be made to ajax.php:

ajax.php?action=getfavoritesjson
Get current user's favorites in json format


ajax.php?action=getcartjson
Get items that are in the current user's cart
